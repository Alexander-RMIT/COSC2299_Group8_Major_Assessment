## Branches description
- The difference between `feature` and `deploy` is that `feature` is the branch that we use to develop the feature, and `deploy` is the branch that we use to deploy the feature to the production environment. The reason why we use two branches is that we want to make sure that the feature is stable before we deploy it to the production environment. Also, for the `feature` branch, Flutter is using `http://10.0.2.2:8080/` but `https://neighborhood-doctors-backend.herokuapp.com/` is used for the Flutter in `deploy` branch.
- The `main` branch is the branch that we use to upload all milestones required files.
